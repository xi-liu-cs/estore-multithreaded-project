Answers to exercises G1--G3:

G1: 

The command recursively searches all files
in the directory, then list all files that
contains the term "smutex" 

vagrant@bullseye:~/cs202/labs-21fa-XiLiu13$ grep -r "smutex"
lab3/sthread.cpp:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex)
lab3/sthread.cpp:void smutex_destroy(smutex_t *mutex)
lab3/sthread.cpp:void smutex_lock(smutex_t *mutex)
lab3/sthread.cpp:void smutex_unlock(smutex_t *mutex)
lab3/sthread.cpp:void scond_signal(scond_t *cond, smutex_t *mutex __attribute__((unused)))
lab3/sthread.cpp:void scond_broadcast(scond_t *cond, smutex_t *mutex __attribute__((unused)))
lab3/sthread.cpp:void scond_wait(scond_t *cond, smutex_t *mutex)
grep: lab3/build/estoresim: binary file matches
grep: lab3/build/sthread.o: binary file matches
lab3/sthread.h:typedef pthread_mutex_t smutex_t;
lab3/sthread.h:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex);
lab3/sthread.h:void smutex_destroy(smutex_t *mutex);
lab3/sthread.h:void smutex_lock(smutex_t *mutex);
lab3/sthread.h:void smutex_unlock(smutex_t *mutex);
lab3/sthread.h:void scond_signal(scond_t *cond, smutex_t *mutex);
lab3/sthread.h:void scond_broadcast(scond_t *cond, smutex_t *mutex);
lab3/sthread.h:void scond_wait(scond_t *cond, smutex_t *mutex);


G2:

grep "Task" RequestGenerator.cpp

grep "return" *.h


G3: 

it recursively searches all files and it returns
lines that are functions that contains "smutex"
they are functions because
the pattern is smutex.*(.*);
.* or dot asterisk means any string,
because of the parentheses and the semicolon,
the lines are function declarations
